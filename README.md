# Practice-Querying-Real-World-Datasets
  *Objectives
  ___________________________________________________________________________________________
  * Understand the dataset for Chicago Public School level performance
  * Store the dataset in an Db2 database on IBM Cloud instance
  * Retrieve metadata about tables and columns and query data from mixed case columns
  * Solve example problems to practice your SQL skills including using built-in database functions

 * Steps Taken to accomplish this project
   1- Downloaded ChicagoPublicSchools.csv
   2- Loaded data into IBM database DB2
   3- Connected to database with python jupiter notbook
   4- Used (%sql select distinct(name), coltype, length from sysibm.syscolumns where tbname= 'SCHOOLS') to check connection success and retreive the table columns scheme
   5- Used (%sql select count(*) from SYSCAT.COLUMNS where TABNAME = 'SCHOOLS') to retrieve the number of columns in table SCHOOLS
   6- Used (%sql select count(*) from SCHOOLS where ELEMENTARY__MIDDLE__OR_HIGH_SCHOOL = 'ES';) to return the number of Elementary schools in table SCHOOLS
   7- Used (%sql select max(SAFETY_SCORE) from SCHOOLS;) to return the heighest saftey score in table SCHOOLS
   8- Used (%sql select Name_of_School, Safety_Score from SCHOOLS where Safety_Score= (select MAX(Safety_Score) from SCHOOLS)) to return the schools have the heighest score in table SCHOOLS
   9- Used (%sql select Name_of_School, AVERAGE_STUDENT_ATTENDANCE from SCHOOLS where average_student_attendance != 'None' Order BY AVERAGE_STUDENT_ATTENDANCE desc LIMIt 10;) to retreive the top 10 schools with the highest "Average Student Attendance
   10- Used (%sql select Name_of_School, AVERAGE_STUDENT_ATTENDANCE from SCHOOLS where average_student_attendance != 'None' Order BY AVERAGE_STUDENT_ATTENDANCE asc LIMIt 5;) to retreive a list of 5 Schools with the lowest Average Student Attendance
   11- Used (%sql select Name_of_School, replace(AVERAGE_STUDENT_ATTENDANCE, '%', '') from SCHOOLS where average_student_attendance != 'None' Order BY AVERAGE_STUDENT_ATTENDANCE asc LIMIt 5;) to replace the % with ''
   12- Used (%sql select Name_of_School, AVERAGE_STUDENT_ATTENDANCE from SCHOOLS where DECIMAL(replace(AVERAGE_STUDENT_ATTENDANCE, '%', '')) < 70;) to retrieve the schools that has average student attendance < 70%
   13- Used (%sql select COMMUNITY_AREA_NAME, sum(College_Enrollment) As "Total Enrollment" from SCHOOLS group by  COMMUNITY_AREA_NAME) to get the total College Enrollment for each Community Area 
   14- Used (%sql select COMMUNITY_AREA_NAME, sum(College_Enrollment) As "Total Enrollment" from SCHOOLS group by  COMMUNITY_AREA_NAME order by "Total Enrollment" asc limit 5) To Get the 5 Community Areas with the least total College Enrollment sorted in ascending order
   15- Used (%sql select Name_of_School, safety_score from SCHOOLS Order BY safety_score asc LIMIt 5;) to get a list of 5 schools with lowest safety score
   16- Used (%sql select hardship_index from chicago_socioeconomic_data CD, schools CPS \
 where CD.ca = CPS.community_area_number \
       and college_enrollment = 4368) to get the hardship index for the community area which has College Enrollment of 4368
       NOTE(table chicago_socioeconomic_data was used here)
   17- Used (%sql select ca, community_area_name, hardship_index from chicago_socioeconomic_data \
    where ca in \
    ( select community_area_number from schools order by college_enrollment desc limit 1 )) to Get the hardship index for the community area which has the school with the highest enrollment
